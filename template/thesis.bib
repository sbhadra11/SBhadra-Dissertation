@article{cannarella_ion,
	Abstract = {We use {AC} impedance methods to investigate the effect of mechanical deformation on ion transport in commercial separator membranes and lithium-ion cells as a whole. A Bruggeman type power law relationship is found to provide an accurate correlation between porosity and tortuosity of deformed separators, which allows the impedance of a separator membrane to be predicted as a function of deformation. By using mechanical compression to vary the porosity of the separator membranes during impedance measurements it is possible to determine both the {\^I}$\pm$ and {\^I}³ parameters from the modified Bruggeman relation for individual separator membranes. From impedance testing of compressed pouch cells it is found that separator deformation accounts for the majority of the transport restrictions arising from compressive stress in a lithium-ion cell. Finally, a charge state dependent increase in the impedance associated with charge transfer is observed with increasing cell compression.},

@article{cannarella_stress,
	Abstract = {The effects of mechanical stress on lithium-ion battery life are investigated by monitoring the stack pressure and capacity of constrained commercial lithium-ion pouch cells during cycling. Stack stress is found to be a dynamic quantity, fluctuating with charge/discharge and gradually increasing irreversibly over long times with cycling. Variations in initial stack pressure, an important controllable manufacturing parameter, are shown to produce different stress evolution characteristics over the lifetime of the cells. Cells manufactured with higher levels of stack pressure are found to exhibit shorter cycle lives, although small amounts of stack pressure lead to increased capacity retention over unconstrained cells. Postmortem analysis of these cells suggests a coupling between mechanics and electrochemistry in which higher levels of mechanical stress lead to higher rates of chemical degradation, while layer delamination is responsible for the capacity fade in unconstrained cells. Localized separator deformation resulting in nonuniform lithium transport is also observed in all cells.},

	Abstract = {We report a size dependence of Young{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s modulus in [0001] oriented {ZnO} nanowires ({NWs)} with diameters ranging from 17 to 550 nm for the first time. The measured modulus for {NWs} with diameters smaller than about 120 nm is increasing dramatically with the decreasing diameters, and is significantly higher than that of the larger ones whose modulus tends to that of bulk {ZnO.} A core-shell composite {NW} model in terms of the surface stiffening effect correlated with significant bond length contractions occurred near the \{101{\^a}{\v Z}¯{\^a}{\v Z}¯0\} free surfaces (which extend several layers deep into the bulk and fade off slowly) is proposed to explore the origin of the size dependence, and present experimental result is well explained. Furthermore, it is possible to estimate the size-related elastic properties of {GaN} nanotubes and relative nanostructures by using this model.},

@article{gallaway,
	Abstract = {The scientific community has focused on the problem of inexpensive, safe, and sustainable large-scale electrical energy storage, which is needed for a number of emerging societal reasons such as stabilizing intermittent renewables-based generation like solar and wind power. The materials used for large-scale storage will need to be low cost, earth-abundant, and safe at the desired scale. The {Zn{\^a}€``MnO2} {\^a}€{\oe}alkaline{\^a}€ battery chemistry is associated with one-time use, despite being rechargeable. This is due to material irreversibilities that can be triggered in either the anode or cathode. However, as Zn and {MnO2} have high energy density and low cost, they are economically attractive even at limited depth of discharge. As received, a standard bobbin-type alkaline cell costs roughly \$20 per {kW} h. The {U.S.} Department of Energy {ARPA-E} \$100 per {kW} h cost target for grid storage is thus close to the cost of alkaline consumer primary cells if re-engineered and/or cycled at 5{\^a}€``20\% nominal capacity. Herein we use a deeply-penetrating in situ technique to observe {ZnO} precipitation near the separator in an alkaline cell anode cycled at 5\% {DOD}, which is consistent with cell failures observed at high cycle life. Alkaline cells designed to avoid such causes of cell failure could serve as a low-cost baseload for large-scale storage.},

@article{ghavami,
	Abstract = {Inhibiting properties of two kinds of surfactant, cationic cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ({CTAB)} and anionic sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate ({SDBS)} with three different concentrations, in relation to zinc passivation have been explained in the primary {Zn/MnO2} alkaline batteries. Discharge performance of alkaline cell affected by utilization of surfactant in anodic gel. Therefore, electrochemical properties of anodic zinc have been investigated by cyclic voltammetry, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy ({SEM)} and ac impedance techniques. The results show that alkaline cell with 0.01 g l{\^a}ˆ'1 of anionic {SDBS} surfactant decreased effectively the rate of zinc-passivation reaction. Also, it exhibited {ZnO} morphology with smaller grain size, causing longer service life gradually, step by step.
By contrast, 0.01 g l{\^a}ˆ'1 of cationic {CTAB} surfactant remarkably increased the rate of charge transfer and mass transfer in the alkaline cell, on impedance data. Consequently, more volumetric energy density obtained in first discharge step due to more activated zinc surface area. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy ({SEM)} has shown non-homogenous morphology with coarse {ZnO} growth. This was confirmed by X-ray diffractograms showing the highest intensity of {ZnO} peak. When the concentration of these surfactants ({CTAB} and {SDBS)} increased, more inhibiting properties were observed. This property was stronger in the cells with anionic {SDBS} surfactant. Our study is mainly focused on the understanding the mechanism of zinc passivation in the presence of the surfactants.},

	Abstract = {Alkaline batteries have been in use for about 100 years. They show excellent performance characteristics, a favorable cost structure, and are extremely reliable [ Solid State Ionics , 134 , 139 (2000) ; J. Power Sources , 127 , 45 (2004) ; J. Power Sources , 103 , 120 (2001) ; J. Power Sources , 105 , 127 (2002) ]. The lifetime is strongly correlated with the dissolution process of the zinc particles in the anode material and the deoxidation of the manganese dioxide in the cathode material [ Power Sources 7 , Academic , New York (1979) ; J. Power Sources , 77 , 127 (1999) ; J. Electrochem. Soc. , 154 , A481 (2007) ; J. Electrochem. Soc. , 152 , A1930 (2005) ; J. Power Sources , 186 , 532 (2009) ; J. Power Sources , 156 , 692 (2006) ]. Parameters that affect the zinc utilization still have to be identified and optimized to continue the improvement of the cell performance [ J. Power Sources , 96 , 133 (2001) ]. By in situ synchrotron tomography, the discharging process of an alkaline cell {LR61} {AAAA} {VARTA} {HighEnergy} was visualized and analyzed quantitatively. The focus of attention was the observation of the zinc particles in the anode electrolyte material. The complete dissolution process of these zinc particles, i.e., the morphology and spatial distribution of zinc and zinc oxide, during discharging was discussed.},

In order to clarify the details of the impact of glass spheres and corundum particles of irregular shape on a solid half-space, the process of interaction of solid particle with target was studied using a Laser Doppler Anemometer ({LDA)} measuring technique. Targets were impacted with particles over the range of impact velocities (7{\^a}€``50 m s{\^a}ˆ'1) at impact angle 67{\^A}$\,^{\circ}$. The experimentally observed variations of the coefficient of velocity restitution as a function of the test material properties, impact velocity and hardness ratio ({Hm/Ha)} are adequately explained on the basis of a theoretical model. Systematic studies of the influence of the impact variables on the collision process have been carried out.},

@article{peabody_separator,
	Abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries are well-known to be plagued by a gradual loss of capacity and power which occur regardless of use and can be limiting factors in the development of emerging energy technologies. Here we show that separator deformation in response to mechanical stimuli that arise under normal operation and storage conditions, such as external stresses on the battery stack or electrode expansion associated with lithium insertion/deinsertion, leads to increased internal resistance and significant capacity fade. We find this mechanically induced capacity fade to be a result of viscoelastic creep in the electrochemically inactive separator which reduces ion transport via a pore closure mechanism. By applying compressive stress on the battery structure we are able to accelerate aging studies and identify this unexpected, but important and fundamental link between mechanical properties and electrochemical performance. Furthermore, by making simple modifications to the electrode structure or separator properties, these effects can be mitigated, providing a pathway for improved battery performance.},

	Abstract = {An in situacoustic emission({AE)} and x-ray diffraction cell for use in the study of battery electrode materials has been designed and tested. This cell uses commercially available coin cell hardware retrofitted with a metalized polyethylene terephthalate ({PET)} disk, which acts as both an x-ray window and a current collector. In this manner, the use of beryllium and its associated cost and hazards is avoided. An {AE} sensor may be affixed to the cell face opposite the {PET} window in order to monitor degradation effects, such as particle fracture, during cell cycling. Silicon particles, which were previously studied by the {AE} technique, were tested in this cell as a model material. The performance of these cells compared well with unmodified coin cells, while providing information about structural changes in the active material as the cell is repeatedly charged and discharged.},
