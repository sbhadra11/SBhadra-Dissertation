	a coupling between mechanics and electrochemistry in which higher

	By using mechanical compression to vary the porosity of the separator
	membranes during impedance measurements it is possible to determine
	both the {\^I}$\pm$ and {\^I}³ parameters from the modified Bruggeman
	relation for individual separator membranes. From impedance testing

	intermittent renewables-based generation like solar and wind power.
	The materials used for large-scale storage will need to be low cost,
	earth-abundant, and safe at the desired scale. The {Zn{\^a}€``MnO2}
	{\^a}€{\oe}alkaline{\^a}€ battery chemistry is associated with one-time
	use, despite being rechargeable. This is due to material irreversibilities
	that can be triggered in either the anode or cathode. However, as
	Zn and {MnO2} have high energy density and low cost, they are economically
	attractive even at limited depth of discharge. As received, a standard
	bobbin-type alkaline cell costs roughly \$20 per {kW} h. The {U.S.}
	Department of Energy {ARPA-E} \$100 per {kW} h cost target for grid
	storage is thus close to the cost of alkaline consumer primary cells
	if re-engineered and/or cycled at 5{\^a}€``20\% nominal capacity.
	Herein we use a deeply-penetrating in situ technique to observe {ZnO}
	precipitation near the separator in an alkaline cell anode cycled
	at 5\% {DOD}, which is consistent with cell failures observed at
	high cycle life. Alkaline cells designed to avoid such causes of
	cell failure could serve as a low-cost baseload for large-scale storage.},

	of surfactant in anodic gel. Therefore, electrochemical properties
	of anodic zinc have been investigated by cyclic voltammetry, X-ray
	diffraction, scanning electron microscopy ({SEM)} and ac impedance
	techniques. The results show that alkaline cell with 0.01 g l{\^a}ˆ'1
	of anionic {SDBS} surfactant decreased effectively the rate of zinc-passivation
	reaction. Also, it exhibited {ZnO} morphology with smaller grain
	size, causing longer service life gradually, step by step. By contrast,
	0.01 g l{\^a}ˆ'1 of cationic {CTAB} surfactant remarkably increased
	the rate of charge transfer and mass transfer in the alkaline cell,
	on impedance data. Consequently, more volumetric energy density obtained
	in first discharge step due to more activated zinc surface area.
	Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy ({SEM)} has shown non-homogenous
	morphology with coarse {ZnO} growth. This was confirmed by X-ray
	diffractograms showing the highest intensity of {ZnO} peak. When
	the concentration of these surfactants ({CTAB} and {SDBS)} increased,
	more inhibiting properties were observed. This property was stronger
	in the cells with anionic {SDBS} surfactant. Our study is mainly
	focused on the understanding the mechanism of zinc passivation in
	the presence of the surfactants.},

	the cathode material [ Power Sources 7 , Academic , New York (1979)

	[ J. Power Sources , 96 , 133 (2001) ]. By in situ synchrotron tomography,
	the discharging process of an alkaline cell {LR61} {AAAA} {VARTA}

  abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries are well-known to be plagued by a gradual loss
	of capacity and power which occur regardless of use and can be limiting
	factors in the development of emerging energy technologies. Here
	we show that separator deformation in response to mechanical stimuli
	that arise under normal operation and storage conditions, such as
	external stresses on the battery stack or electrode expansion associated
	with lithium insertion/deinsertion, leads to increased internal resistance
	and significant capacity fade. We find this mechanically induced
	capacity fade to be a result of viscoelastic creep in the electrochemically
	inactive separator which reduces ion transport via a pore closure
	mechanism. By applying compressive stress on the battery structure
	we are able to accelerate aging studies and identify this unexpected,
	but important and fundamental link between mechanical properties
	and electrochemical performance. Furthermore, by making simple modifications
	to the electrode structure or separator properties, these effects
	can be mitigated, providing a pathway for improved battery performance.},
