    \caption[Full acoustic waveform of a \ce{LiCoO2}/graphite prismatic cell.]{Full acoustic waveform of a \ce{LiCoO2}/graphite prismatic cell. \textbf{(a,b)} ToF maps for transmission and reflection modes, respectively, \textbf{(c)} total reflected (red) and transmitted (green) signal amplitudes, \textbf{(d,e)} traces for the amplitudes of transmitted waves 1 and 3, respectively, \textbf{(f)} cell potential, and \textbf{(g)} applied current as a function of cycling time. The vertical gray lines in panels c-g represent transitions between charge, discharge, and rest stepsÍ¾ arrows 1, 3, and 10 as well as markings *1 and *2 are discussed in the text.}

An extra one hour rest step was added around hour 96 of testing. The vertical gray lines in panels c-e represent transitions between charge, discharge, and rest steps.}
